 *  ========reserve keywords=============
 *  javascript keywords are reserved words. keywords can not be used as variable names, function names etc in our javascript programs. some keywords are :
 *      ==> var, continue, false, let, break, do, finally, null, case, while, for, return, catch, const, function, switch, class, else, if, await,
 *      
 *        keywords are case sensitive. for example,
 *          var name = 'john'; 
 *          VAR name = 'john'; // this is wrong
 *          Var name = 'john'; // this is wrong
 * 
 *      =====for example, you cannot write the following==========
 *      var false = "peter";
 *      var for =  15;
 *      
 *      
 *
