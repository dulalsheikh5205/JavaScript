Q. what is javascript?

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.


JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)


JavaScript is a programming language used primarily to create interactive web pages and dynamic user interfaces. It is a high-level, interpreted language, which means that it can be executed directly by web browsers without the need for compilation. JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create web applications, and it can also be used to create server-side applications using platforms such as Node.js.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including client-side form validation, creating animations, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), and making asynchronous requests to web servers. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web and is supported by all modern web browsers.


JavaScript is a hight level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages more interactive. It let's you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages.

example....

// Define a variable and assign it a value
var x = 5;

// Use an if statement to check a condition
if (x > 3) {
  console.log("x is greater than 3");
} else {
  console.log("x is not greater than 3");
}

// Define a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Call the function and store the result in a variable
var sum = addNumbers(2, 3);

// Display the result in the console
console.log("The sum of 2 and 3 is " + sum);

// ctrl + J => Terminal
// ctrl + Shift + backtick ` => Terminal => node (filename) => enter
 

console.log(555);
